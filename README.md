# Hybrid Cloud for Architects
This is the code repository for [Hybrid Cloud for Architects](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/hybrid-cloud-architects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788623513), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Hybrid cloud is currently the buzz word in the cloud world. Organizations are planning to adopt hybrid cloud strategy due to its advantages such as untested workloads, cloud-bursting, cloud service brokering and so on. This book will help you understand the dynamics, design principles, and deployment strategies of a Hybrid Cloud.

You will start by understanding the concepts of hybrid cloud and the problems it solves as compared to a stand-alone public and private cloud. You will be delving into the different architecture and design of hybrid cloud. The book will then cover advanced concepts such as building a deployment pipeline, containerization strategy, and data storage mechanism. Next up, you will be able to deploy an external CMP to run a Hybrid cloud and integrate it with your OpenStack and AWS environments. You will also understand the strategy for designing a Hybrid Cloud using containerization and work with pre-built solutions like vCloud Air, VMware for AWS, and Azure Stack. Finally, the book will cover security and monitoring related best practices that will help you secure your cloud infrastructure.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
provider "aws" {
 access_key = "<Enter Access Key Here>"
 secret_key = "<Enter Secret Key Here>"
 region = "us-east-1"
}
```

While a simple reading of the book will impart the different architectural and cloud concepts to the reader, in order to follow along, ensure that you have the following:
* An internet connection to download the software.
* A Ubuntu 16.04 machine to act as the management system.
* A fully functioning OpenStack deployment or a Ubuntu 16.04 machine to run DevStack.
* AWS user account—if you don't have the user account, ensure that you have your credit card ready in order to open a free account. (Remember that while we have taken care to use the free-tier systems in AWS, make sure you use the appropriate instance sizes and AMI IDs if you are creating the environment in a different region).
